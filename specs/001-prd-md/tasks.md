## Dependencies

**Critical Ordering**:
- Setup (T001-T004) before everything
- Contract tests (T005-T012) before ANY implementation
- Core models (T013-T018) before services (T019-T024)
- Services before real_ai_tab.py upgrade (T025-T029)
- Security/observability (T030-T033) before CLI integration (T034-T037)
- All implementation before polish (T038-T044)

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- T013 blocks T019, T022, T023 (ConversationSession needed for orchestration)
- T014 blocks T020, T021 (TurnMessage needed for adapters)
- T016 blocks T019, T025, T029 (PolicyConfiguration needed for enforcement)
- T020, T021 block T025-T029 (adapter upgrades needed for real_ai_tab.py)
- T022, T023 block T025-T029 (orchestrator/session management needed)

## Key Implementation Notes

**real_ai_tab.py Upgrade Strategy** (T025-T029):
- Replace subprocess stdout parsing with proper adapter pattern usage
- Integrate with existing production-ready components in src/tab/
- Maintain backward compatibility while adding PRD compliance features
- Focus on structured output, session management, and observability integration

**Security Focus** (T019, T031, T033, T042):
- Implement MAESTRO threat model recommendations from research.md
- Rootless container execution with strict capability controls
- Cryptographic audit logging for compliance requirements
- Permission boundary enforcement with real-time validation

**Observability Focus** (T030, T041, T043):
- OpenTelemetry spans for every conversation turn and agent interaction
- Performance validation against <200ms latency requirements
- Comprehensive metrics for cost tracking and budget enforcement
- Structured logging with trace correlation

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All entities (6) have model tasks (T013-T018)
- [x] All tests (T005-T012) come before implementation (T013+)
- [x] Parallel tasks [P] are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] real_ai_tab.py upgrade addresses user context requirements
- [x] Production readiness covers security, observability, and performance
