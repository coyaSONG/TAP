# Feature Specification: Twin-Agent Bridge (TAB) - Claude Code × Codex CLI Bidirectional Q&A Bridge

**Feature Branch**: `001-prd-md`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@PRD.md t 8| 8pt Ý1tü8”"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract requirements from PRD.md for bidirectional agent communication system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: orchestration, MCP integration, security sandboxing, observability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Cross-verification workflows between Claude Code and Codex CLI
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DevInfra engineer, I want to enable Claude Code and Codex CLI to engage in structured bidirectional conversations to cross-verify code analysis, bug reproduction, and patch proposals, so that I can leverage the strengths of both tools for more reliable automated code review and development workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a code repository with potential race conditions, **When** I initiate a cross-verification session asking "analyze race condition risks in this module", **Then** Claude provides initial analysis and Codex performs counter-verification with evidence, leading to a consensus within 4-6 conversation turns
2. **Given** a reported bug, **When** I request bug reproduction and patch suggestions, **Then** Codex reproduces the issue with test cases and Claude provides refactoring advice, resulting in a consolidated patch proposal with both tools' input
3. **Given** permission restrictions are configured, **When** either agent attempts unauthorized file modifications or command execution, **Then** the system blocks the action and logs the security event for audit purposes
4. **Given** a conversation exceeds turn limits or budget constraints, **When** the orchestrator detects these conditions, **Then** the system terminates gracefully and provides a summary of progress made

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one agent becomes unresponsive or returns malformed output during conversation?
- How does the system handle conflicting recommendations from both agents?
- What occurs when session state cannot be maintained due to tool limitations?
- How are infinite conversation loops prevented when agents disagree persistently?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST orchestrate bidirectional conversations between Claude Code and Codex CLI agents
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse and route structured messages between agents in standardized format
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain conversation state and context across multiple turn exchanges
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce configurable turn limits and budget constraints to prevent runaway conversations
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement permission controls to restrict agent actions to approved operations only
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide observability through comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect conversation convergence patterns and terminate when consensus is reached
- **FR-008**: System MUST support sandbox execution environments to isolate agent operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle agent failures with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- **FR-010**: System MUST export conversation transcripts and audit logs for compliance review
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent interoperability [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific MCP version requirements and feature dependencies]
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate agent responses against security policies before execution [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific security validation rules and criteria]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support headless operation mode for CI/CD integration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific CI/CD platform requirements and integration methods]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Conversation Session**: Represents a complete multi-turn dialogue between agents, includes turn history, state, and metadata
- **Turn Message**: Individual communication unit containing agent identity, content, role designation, and policy constraints
- **Agent Adapter**: Interface wrapper for each CLI tool providing standardized communication protocol
- **Policy Configuration**: Permission and constraint definitions governing agent behavior and resource access
- **Audit Record**: Security and compliance log entry tracking agent actions, decisions, and system events
- **Orchestration State**: Current conversation context, participant status, and flow control information
